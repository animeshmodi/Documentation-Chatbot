    Additional Notes
    
        The system uses a topic-based approach to identify relevant answers. The accuracy of the answers depends on the quality of the document processing and the clarity of your questions.
        The system may not be able to answer complex or open ended questions that require reasoning or interpretation beyond the document's content.
        Feel free to experiment with different types of questions to test the system's capabilities.
